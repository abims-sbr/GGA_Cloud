Galaxy Genome Annotation usage
==============================


Once the docker containers are alive, go to https://your_host/sp/genus_species/galaxy/.

There is a shared administration account, you must use it on this galaxy server, and it is an admin user for apollo too.

There, you have access to an admin-only galaxy server with tools to populate the various applications with the genome data.
